    problem="A handful of companies control the compute, models, and data that power AI. They publish scale to make it feel impossible. They never publish what actually makes it work. This isn't conspiracy; it's just economics. Training frontier models costs hundreds of millions of dollars. GPU computing is dominated by a handful of players. The chips that power everything flow through two or three companies."
    quote="There is now a 'compute divide' between Big Tech and conventional R&D centers like universities, leading to increasing concentration of GenAI research in the hands of a few companies."

    why_matters="When only a few can build, only a few decide what gets built. Research narrows. Innovation follows money. And the rest of us become consumers of technology we can neither understand nor influence."
    ohgod_solution="OHGOD!! What if powerful AI can be trained on a consumer GPU in 24 hours? The compute moat might disappear. Universities won't need cloud credits to teach AI. Hobbyists could experiment and have fun."
